# # Decaying Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence - 2D
#
# In this example we consider decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence,
# similar to the cases considered in [Kochkov2021](@cite) and
# [Kurz2022](@cite). The initial velocity field is created randomly, but with a
# specific energy spectrum. Due to viscous dissipation, the turbulent features
# eventually group to form larger visible eddies.

# ## Packages
#
# We just need IncompressibleNavierStokes and a Makie plotting backend.
